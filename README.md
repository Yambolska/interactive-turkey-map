This project is an interactive map of Turkey created using Python and the Turtle graphics library. It allows users to input the name of any Turkish city, and the program will display its location on the map based on previously obtained coordinates.

Features:

-City Search: Enter the name of a Turkish city and the program will show its location on the Turkey map.
-Pre-recorded Coordinates: The coordinates for Turkish cities have already been collected and saved in a CSV file.
-Simple Interaction: Just input the city name, and the program will plot it on the map.

Technologies Used:

-Python
-Turtle Graphics Library
-Pandas Library

Install Python (if not already installed):

Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Run the program:
python turkey_map.py

How It Works:

-The program allows you to input a Turkish city's name.
-Based on the pre-recorded coordinates (saved in the CSV file), the program will display the city's location on the Turkey map.
-The method for capturing the coordinates from the map is included in the script as a comment, so users can experiment with it if they wish to gather their own data.

CSV File:

The cities_coordinates.csv file contains the city names along with their corresponding X and Y coordinates on the map.
